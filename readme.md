# Factory Pattern

Some examples for how to implement a factory pattern.

The main thing I wanted to show was to make the factory dynamic, so that you do not have to update the factory if you add a new type of return object. This is a key to the Factory Pattern, and OOP.

The php files go from typical code, to slight improvement or difference, and how to get to a better factory.
