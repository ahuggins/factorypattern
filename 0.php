# Factory Pattern

The Factory Method pattern is a design pattern used to define a runtime interface for creating an object.

Itâ€™s called a factory because it creates various types of objects without necessarily knowing what kind of object it creates or how to create it.



Basically means that a call is made to a factory and an object is returned. The factory doesn't really care what kind of object it returns, it just tries to return something.
